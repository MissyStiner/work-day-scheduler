## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule<br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a time block<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist
